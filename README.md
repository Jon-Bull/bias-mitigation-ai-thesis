## Abstract  
As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, addressing biases within AI systems becomes more pressing. This thesis investigates the potential of developing a framework that leverages user metadata to reduce bias in AI datasets while maintaining compliance with GDPR regulations.  

A literature review highlights the importance of diverse, high-quality data and the gaps related to annotator demographics and user metadata in mitigating bias. The thesis also demonstrates a prototype for GDPR-compliant data collection and consent management.  

The findings suggest that incorporating user metadata can enhance fairness in AI systems, supporting AI Act principles of bias mitigation and data governance.

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, the challenge of addressing biases within AI systems becomes more pressing. This thesis investigates the potential of developing a framework that leverages user metadata to reduce bias in AI datasets while maintaining compliance with GDPR regulations. An extensive literature review is conducted to understand the extent and sources of bias in AI, followed by a semi-automated system design approach and demonstration of key concepts with a simple prototype.  

The literature review highlights that AI development is highly dependent on increased quantity, diversity, and quality of data. It also underscores that bias in AI is a significant issue originating from various sources, such as data annotation and dataset composition. The review discover a research gap regarding the role of user metadata and annotator diversity in causing these biases, and the potential for leveraging this user metadata to help mitigate bias.  

The prototype demonstrate practical solutions for obtaining user consent, collecting data and facilitating data annotation in compliance with GDPR. It showcases the potential for users to continuously manage their data contributions and consents, ensuring it can be utilized ethically and legally. This proves that it is feasible to leverage user data while adhering to GDPR, provided proper measures are in place. Ensuring informed user consent, understanding implications, and allowing easy modification of consent without negative consequences are vital steps in this process. The prototype visualise a way developers and researchers can analyse and adjust the demographic representation of annotators within a set of training data in order to mitigate bias.  

The findings suggest that developing a framework for incorporating user metadata can lay the groundwork for more equitable AI systems. Although this thesis does not evaluate alignment with the AI Act, the proposed platform serves as a foundational tool that supports its principles, such as ensuring high-quality, bias-free data. This thesis concludes with an approach that we believe to be a solid foundation for mitigating bias in AI, highlighting the importance of transparency, human oversight, and data governance.
